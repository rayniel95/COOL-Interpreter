# COOL-Interpreter
COOL interpreter with type inference functionality.

# How it work:
Run ./code/main.py with some path to a test case. Test case with 'test_case_name-copia'.cl name will have AUTO_TYPE, 
the test case without '-copia' are the original test case.

Note: this interpreter can be improved, example --> take a look to if/else block.
